# 8085asm

This is my study project for system programming and compiler construction course. It is a 8085 assembler that supports directives like DB, DW, END, EQU, ORG. It is capable of perfroming simple macro processing. To run the project type "make" in the src/ folder and then run ./8085asm <path to asm file>. Note: the asm file must end with .asm extension.
